// Solution to the second problem on Project Euler https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

/* Function uses a while loop to iterate over each fibonacci value up until 4 million. 
It then checks to see if each value is divisible by 2. If it is, it is added to the variable
sum. If not, it continues to the next value. Variables a, b and c represent 3 consecutive
fibonacci values for the while loop to iterate over. */
